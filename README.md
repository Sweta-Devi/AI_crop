AI-Based Crop Recommendation for Farmers —
 Hackathon Blueprint
 Project at a glance
 Title: AI-Based Crop Recommendation for Farmers
 Organization: Government of Jharkhand — Department of Higher and Technical Education
 Category / Theme: Software — Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development
 Goal (short): Build a mobile-first prototype that provides localized, science-guided crop recommendations
 to smallholder farmers using satellite/IoT data, local weather, crop-rotation history, and market signals —
 with multilingual voice/chat and image-based support for disease detection.
 Executive summary
 
 Create a lightweight mobile application (Android-first) that connects to a backend platform able to: - ingest
 satellite datasets and IoT sensor feeds to estimate field-level soil properties (pH, moisture, key nutrients); 
combine local weather forecasts and historical crop-rotation to recommend optimal crops and sowing
 windows; - forecast expected yield, profitability, and a sustainability score for each recommended crop; 
expose a simple multilingual UI with voice/chat support and offline-first capabilities; and - accept images
 from the farmer (leaf/plant photos) for disease/pest detection and give actionable remediation steps.
 The hackathon deliverable is a working prototype showcasing the end-to-end flow: farmer input → data
 fusion → model decision → explanation + visuals + localized audio.
 Objectives & success criteria
 
 Primary objectives 1. Produce accurate, actionable crop recommendations for a specified parcel/geo
coordinates. 2. Provide yield and profit-range estimates and sustainability guidance (rotations, fertilizer
 reduction tips). 3. Support local languages (e.g., Hindi + one local Jharkhand language) via TTS/STT and chat.
 4. Demonstrate image-based disease detection and a clear remediation action. 5. Work offline for core
 features (recommendation cache + local data capture).
 Hackathon success metrics - End-to-end demo: mobile app + backend responding to at least 3 distinct
 farmer queries. ✅ - Accuracy proxy: model recommendations align with domain expert rules for at least
 80% of test cases. ✅ - Latency: recommendation response under 6 seconds (on network). ✅ - Offline
 fallbacks: input capture and cached recommendations work offline. ✅ - Usability: basic voice interaction
 and Hindi interface functioning. ✅
